## Project Overview
This project implements the model from the paper [**DWFORMER: Dynamic Window Transformer for Speech Emotion Recognition**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01694) by Shuaiqi Chen, Xiaofen Xing, Weibin Zhang, Weidong Chen, and Xiangmin Xu. The goal of the project is to perform **Speech Emotion Recognition** using the **IEMOCAP Dataset**.

Download the IEMOCAP Dataset from drive link attached. 
We will have to launch two seperate python environment 
1) One for feature extraction
2) Another for model training and validation

## Dataset
The **IEMOCAP Dataset** is used in this project. Please download the dataset using the following link: [Google Drive Link](#).


This is done to prevent any issues rising up as few of the modules use different version of libaries which can cause issue in installing the **Fairseq** module by Facebook.
